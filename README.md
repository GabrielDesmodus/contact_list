# contact_list
(College project from late 2019 - Data Structures)C program that allows you to create, modify and save the contact list on a file.

**Language - Portuguese**

The program works with a list of elements defined by a Structure which stores the data of each client on its members of different types.
There are encapsulated functions to insert, remove, edit, consult(by name, position and code), read and save the contacts on a  binary file.

**Manual:**

- The program will read the file on the start and save it on the end of the program. 
- The file will only be saved if the program be closed by one of the commands. 
- If a file doesn't exist, the program will create one. 
- The file will always be located on the Project root directory.
- Don't use the same identification code for more than one contact.
